The "lcmaps-plugins-mount-under-scratch" plugin allows the admin to setup
per-invocation copies of world-writable directories such as /tmp or /var/tmp.

This plugin will create a temporary directory of the form:

/tmp/glexec_mount_under_scratch_XXXXXX

and subdirectories

/tmp/glexec_mount_under_scratch_MuLdpO:
    tmp/
    var/tmp

owned by the payload user.

Further, /tmp will map to /tmp/glexec_mount_under_scratch_MuLdpO/tmp
and /var/tmp will map to /tmp/glexec_mount_under_scratch_MuLdpO/var/tmp for
the payload process (and *only* the payload process).

If /tmp or /var/tmp are on a shared-bind-mount (meaning the parent and child
namespace are identical for a subtree), the most specific subtree will be
remounted as private.

The above paragraphs are similar for admin-defined directories.  The admin can
pass:

-path /var/tmp
-path /tmp
-path /foo
-path /bar

as arguments in lcmaps.db to the plugin to remap /var/tmp, /tmp, /foo, and /bar

This plugin takes its inspiration from the implementation of the
MOUNT_UNDER_SCRATCH parameter in Condor, and is necessary for
MOUNT_UNDER_SCRATCH to work with glexec'd jobs.  Note the plugin does not
cleanup the created directories - that is the responsibility of the invoker;
note that this limitation means this plugin only makes sense when /tmp and
/var/tmp are job-specific already (i.e., when used with MOUNT_UNDER_SCRATCH).
